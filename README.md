## Predicting the score of a Rugby match using Linear Regression

The goal of this project was to use linear regression to predict England's score for an international rugby match based on previous match statistics, location, time of year and opponents. Scraped international rugby match data from multiple sources and combined these using Pandas. Utilized linear regression, regularization techniques and feature engineering to optimize the model and make a prediction for an upcoming match.Â 

**Tools:**   
- Python (pandas, statsmodels, sklearn)  
- WebScraping (Selenium, Beautiful Soup)   
- Supervised Learning techniques (Linear Regression, Regularization - LASSO & Ridge)

**Repository Includes:**
- Jupyter Notebook of full project process
- Modules including built functions for the process
